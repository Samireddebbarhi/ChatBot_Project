# Next.js Chatbot Project

## Overview

This is a simple chatbot application built using Next.js, a popular React framework for building server-side rendered and statically generated websites and applications. The chatbot integrates with the OpenAI API to provide conversational responses to user inputs.

## Features

*   User-friendly chat interface
*   Integration with OpenAI API for generating conversational responses
*   Server-side rendering for improved performance and SEO

## Concepts Used

*   **Next.js**: A React framework for building server-side rendered and statically generated websites and applications.
*   **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
*   **OpenAI API**: A powerful API for generating human-like text based on the input it receives.
*   **API Routes**: Next.js allows you to create API endpoints as Node.js serverless functions.
*   **Environment Variables**: Used to store sensitive information like API keys.
*   **Axios**: A popular JavaScript library used for making HTTP requests.
